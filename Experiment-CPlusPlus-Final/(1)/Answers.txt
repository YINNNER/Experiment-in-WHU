(a)What is the output?
   
in constructor,nCharArray=0
in constructor,nCharArray=1
in constructor,nCharArray=1
in oprator[],nCharArray=2
abc
pbc
in operator=,nCharArray=2
in operator=,nCharArray=1
pbc
pbc
in destructor,nCharArray=1
in destructor,nCharArray=1
in destructor,nCharArray=0


(b)What does nCharArray stand for? Is it equal to the number of String objects?
   
nCharArray standS for the number of the character arrays.
It is not equal to the number of String objects.


(c)Why is the value of nCharArray less than the number of String objects?
   
Because more than one objects can point to the same array. For example, after the statement “s1=s3;s2=s3;”,all the 3 objects point one character array “3pbc”.

(d)In class String, str[0] is the reference count, whose maximum value is 255. Where is the content of String object?
   
The content of String object is the element of the character array to which str is pointed from str[1] to str[_len+1].


(e)How can we know that two String objects share the same memory space?

We can judge it from str[0], the reference count. If its value is 2, then we can know that two String objects share the same memory space.
